gremlin-v3
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jimlloyd/gremlin-v3.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jimlloyd/gremlin-v3)

Implementation of [Gremlin/TinkerPop3](https://github.com/tinkerpop/tinkerpop3) for node.js. Gremlin-v3 is a javascript wrapper around the TinkerPop3 API. The node-java module provides the bridge between node and Java.

**NOTE: This package is compatible with TinkerPop3. For TinkerPop2 compatibility, see the upstream repository [gremlin-node](https://github.com/inolen/gremlin-node).**

**NOTE: This is a Work In Progress. Unit tests pass using TinkerPop3, but much of the TinkerPop2 heritage is still present.  **

```javascript
var Gremlin = require('gremlin');
var gremlin = new Gremlin({
  classpath: [ ... ],
  options: [ ... ]
});

var TinkerGraphFactory = gremlin.java.import('com.tinkerpop.gremlin.tinkergraph.structure.TinkerFactory');
var graph = TinkerGraphFactory.createClassicSync();
var g = gremlin.wrap(graph);

g.V('name', 'marko').next(function (err, v) {
  v.value('name', function (err, value) {
    console.log(value);
  });
});
```

## Promises/A+ API

Gremlin-v3 supports the use of Promises/A+ for most functions taking a callback. For example, a portion of the above code could be written as:

```javascript
g.V('name', 'marko').next().then(
  function (v) {
    v.value('name').then(console.log);
  });
```

This snippet by itself may seem underwhelming, but consider that with some enhanecments to the gremlin-console application, promises make it possible to interact with gremlin in the console as if the promise-returning functions returned values:

```
node > var pipe = g.V('name', 'marko')
node > var v = pipe.next()
node > v.value('name')
'marko'
```

The gremlin-console application contained in this package does not yet have these enhancements. For early access to a console with these enhancements, use the repository [gremlin-repl](https://github.com/jimlloyd/gremlin-repl).

## Dependencies

[__node-java__](https://github.com/joeferner/node-java)

Bridge API to connect with existing Java APIs. Please read the [__node-java__](https://github.com/joeferner/node-java) installation notes, as it outlines how to install the node-java module on specific platforms and its dependencies.

*NOTE: TinkerPop3 requires Java 1.8.*

[__maven__](http://maven.apache.org/index.html)

Maven enables the installation of the base jar files.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install gremlin-v3
```

gremlin-v3 includes the required .jar files for Gremlin and the TinkerPop stack. It doesn't include any backend specific jars for databases such as Titan or OrientDB.

## Configuration

The `Gremlin` constructor takes in an object with two properties; `classpath` which allows you to load in jar files from your own project and `options` which allows you to supply parameters to the Java runtime.

```javascript
var Gremlin = require('gremlin');
var gremlin = new Gremlin({
  classpath: [
    path.join(__dirname, '..', 'target', '**', '*.jar')
  ],
  options: [
    '-XX:+UseThreadPriorities',
    '-XX:ThreadPriorityPolicy=42',
    '-XX:+UseParNewGC',
    '-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC',
    '-XX:+CMSParallelRemarkEnabled',
    '-XX:SurvivorRatio=8',
    '-XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=1',
    '-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=75',
    '-XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly',
    '-XX:+UseTLAB',
    '-XX:+UseCondCardMark'
  ]
});
```

## Connecting to a Graph

As mentioned above, gremlin-v3 only includes jars for the reference TinkerPop3 implementation, TinkerGraph.

To use another database implementing the **TinkerPop3** property graph interfaces, the Gremlin constructor must point to a location with the databases compiled jars.

Once the dependent jars are properly loaded into the Java runtime, a graph instance must be created and passed to `gremlin.wrap`.

**Note: Titan 0.4/0.5 is not compatible with TinkerPop3. Titan 0.9 is under development, and has not yet beeen tested with this package.**

### TinkerGraph

```javascript
var TinkerGraphFactory = gremlin.java.import('com.tinkerpop.gremlin.tinkergraph.structure.TinkerFactory');
var graph = TinkerGraphFactory.openSync();
var g = gremlin.wrap(graph);
```

## Working with the Database

Once you have connected to the database, you are able to call all implementation specific database methods. For example here's how you would add two Vertices and an Edge and associate them in an OrientDB graph.

```javascript
var luca = graph.addVertexSync(null);
luca.setPropertySync( 'name', 'Luca' );

var marko = graph.addVertexSync(null);
marko.setPropertySync( 'name', 'Marko' );

var lucaKnowsMarko = graph.addEdgeSync(null, luca, marko, 'knows');

graph.commitSync();
```

## Examples

A good resource to understand the Gremlin API (for TinkerPop2) is [GremlinDocs](http://gremlindocs.com/).  Most of the examples given at GremlinDocs have been translated to work in a node REPL, and encoded to run as unit tests, but in a separate repository. See [gremlin-repl](https://github.com/jimlloyd/gremlin-repl), and in particular these expected output files:
